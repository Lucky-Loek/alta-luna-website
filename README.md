# Alta Luna website

This repo contains the website for Dutch indierock band Alta Luna, hosted at [https://altalunaband.com](https://altalunaband.com).

## Installation

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Svelte](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode).

```shell
$ npm install

# Local development
$ npm run dev

# Build for production
$ npm run build
$ npm run preview # To preview production build
```

Since the website does not contain credentials and is statically hosted on a shared hosting service without Node or NPM, the `dist` folder is kept in the repository. This allows for easy deployments by just targeting `dist` as the DocumentRoot.
